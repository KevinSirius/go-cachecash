# go-cachecash

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/cachecashproject/go-cachecash.svg?token=utLK2DGqpJaDNkKeJ4fh&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/cachecashproject/go-cachecash)

## Cloning the git repository

This repository uses `git-lfs` for test data artifacts, among other things; you'll need to install it:

```bash
# Ubuntu
apt-get install git-lfs

# macOS
brew install git-lfs

# Archlinux
pacman -S git-lfs

# Windows
Download from https://git-lfs.github.com/
```

Next, clone the cachecash repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:cachecashproject/go-cachecash.git "$(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/cachecashproject/go-cachecash"
```

And initialize git-lfs in that repo:

```bash
cd "$(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/cachecashproject/go-cachecash"
git lfs install
git lfs fetch
git lfs checkout
```

## Running a local test network

The easiest way to get cachecash up and running is starting the test network with docker-compose. The first step is
building all images:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

Next, bring up the network:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

It's going to take 1-2 minutes until everything is initialized, this includes the postgres initialization, the caches
announcing themselves to the bootstrap service, the publisher requesting a list of all caches from the bootstrap service
and finally the publisher and the caches negotiating an escrow, and a distributed tracing backend store. After the escrow
is setup you can download from the caches using `cachecash-curl` or [typescript-cachecash]:

In this case we're going to use the `cachecash-curl` program at this publisher to see it fetch data. The resulting file
(here, `output.bin`) should exactly match the original artifact (here, `testdata/content/file0.bin`).

The `-logLevel` option can be changed to control output verbosity for each program.

```bash
make cachecash-curl && ./bin/cachecash-curl -o output.bin -logLevel=debug -trace http://localhost:14268 cachecash://localhost:7070/file0.bin
diff output.bin testdata/content/file0.bin
```

## Setting up a development environment

You will need a working Go toolchain.  We tend to stay on the latest stable version.

You will also need some extra code generation tools:

```bash
make dev-setup
```

To generate source from proto files:

```bash
make gen
```

To generate documentation from the proto files:

```bash
make gen-docs
```

## Running tests

```bash
# Remove cached results.  (Should not normally be necessary, but can be useful while working on the test suite.)
go clean -testcache

# Run unit and integration tests that do not have external dependencies.
go test -v -race ./...
```

## Running tests that use postgres

To run tests that use postgres, you must launch it first; you can use this command to launch your postgres container:

```shell
docker run --name db-hostname -p 5432:5432 -d -e POSTGRES_DB=dbname postgres:11

# Run a test that has external dependencies, including those automatically
# generated by the ORM system.

PSQL_USER=postgres PSQL_SSLMODE=disable PSQL_HOST=localhost PSQL_DBNAME=dbname \
go test -v -race -tags="external_test sqlboiler_test" ./path/to/test/...
```

## Environment variables

CACHECASH_INSECURE can be set for any binary to disable TLS checking against the
bootstrap/publisher/observability endpoints. Protocol cryptography is still
secure.
